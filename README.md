# bluez-dbus
bluetooth library for linux OSes using DBus and bluez (http://www.bluez.org/). 

This project was inspired by tinyb (https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/tinyb),
but does not require any wrapper library except the unix-domain-socket library of Matthew Johnson.
This wrapper library is included in debian based systems (can be installed with apt-get), so
no self-compilering of any stuff is required.
