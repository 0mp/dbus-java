# bluez-dbus
bluetooth library for linux OSes using [DBus](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/) and [bluez](http://www.bluez.org/).

This project was inspired by [tinyb](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/tinyb),
but does not require any wrapper library except the
unix-domain-socket library of [Matthew Johnson](http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java/).

This wrapper library is included in debian based systems (can be installed with apt-get), so
no self-compiling of any stuff is required.
